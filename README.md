## Overview:
The main purpose of this project is to create a statistical analysis of the weather patterns of Hawaii. Throughout the analysis,  we focused primarily on the months of June and December. We use statistical analysis i.e interquartile ranges such as median, maximum, and minimum temperatures. 


## Results:
Comparison of June Temperature vs December Temperature Analysis: 

The images below show the direct differences between the two months. 

June:

December:

### Temperature Differences:
Looking at the max temperatures for the month of June are 85 degrees and for the month of December are 83 degrees. Considering many other countries in the world, Hawaii has a very minor difference in max temperature for a summer month vs. a winter month. The same also applies to the minimum temperature (June = 56 degrees vs. December = 64 degrees) 

## Summary 
This analysis's conclusion shows that Hawaii's weather doesn't fluctuate drastically and that it would be fine to keep the shop open year long. 

There are a couple other queries that we can find using our data. One would be to see the level of rainfall between the months and determine which one might have more. We can also compare other months to see which would be the most suitable and provide an incentive to travel during these specific months.
